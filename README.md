The eXtensible Text Framework (XTF) is a powerful open source platform for providing access to digital 
content. Developed and maintained by the California Digital Library (CDL), XTF functions as the primary 
access technology for the CDL's digital collections and other digital projects worldwide.

Much more information is available here: http://xtf.cdlib.org

We love pull requests!

*** This a clone of the orginal Mercurial repository for XTF, hosted at 
http://hg.code.sf.net/p/xtf/code. There is another git clone of XTF at
https://github.com/cdlib/xtf, but it does not has the tags for releases.
